# Resistor Color Code Calculator

A Python application built with Kivy that calculates the resistance value based on color codes. The application allows users to select colors for the three bands of a resistor and a tolerance band. It then calculates and displays the resistance value with appropriate prefixes (e.g., K for kiloohms, M for megaohms) and tolerance range.

## Features
- Select colors for resistor bands and tolerance.
- Displays the resistance value in ohms with correct prefix and tolerance.
- Intuitive interface for color selection.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
